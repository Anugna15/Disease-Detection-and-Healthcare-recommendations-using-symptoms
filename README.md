# AI Companion for Personalized Healthcare

## Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based Machine 
Learning web application that predicts diseases based on user-provided symptoms and provides personalized healthcare recommendations. The app uses a trained machine learning model (Random Forest) for disease prediction.

## Features
- Select symptoms from a predefined list.
- Predicts the most probable disease based on user input.
- Provides relevant information, including:
  - Disease description
  - Prescription recommendations
  - Precautionary measures
  - Suggested diet plans
  - Recommended workouts
- Interactive and user-friendly UI with Streamlit.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-Learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Pickle (for model storage)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anugna15/Disease-Detection-and-Healthcare-recommendations-using-symptoms.git
   cd Disease-Detection-and-Healthcare-recommendations-using-symptoms
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure the necessary dataset files (`diseases.csv`, `symptoms.csv`) are available in the project directory.

## Running the Application
1. Train the model and save it as `random_forest.pkl` if not already done.
2. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Open the generated local URL in your browser.
